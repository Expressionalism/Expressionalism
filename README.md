Expressionalism: Measuring Meaning
License: CC BY 4.0 MIT License
Expressionalism: A provisional, dialectical framework for measuring meaning via expressions. Bootstraps from ontological neutrality to relational truths and tensive ratios. Includes toolkit, Python script, glossary, metric proofs, and critiques. Open for hacks & refinements. expressionalism.com
What is Expressionalism?
Expressionalism is a conditional, dialectical framework that starts from ontological neutrality and builds relational structures for expressions—fallible secondary expressions emerging as certainties (connectable contrasts, alignments, utilities) tempered by uncertainties (gaps, pauses, unknowables). It derives truth as guessed probabilistic relations and meaning as certainty-uncertainty tensions.

Key Features: Agnostic to metaphysics, equitable across traditions (analytic, Eastern non-duals, indigenous), 11 presumptions for self-enforcing utility, baked-in fallibility via self-refutations/high uncertainties.
Toolkit: Operationalizes the framework with phases, toggles (e.g., Certainty Temper Probe), metrics (e.g., harmony index elevating fragility), and a Python script for analysis.
Why Share? Provisional and hackable—use it to unpack ideas, refine claims, or measure meaning in expressions/phenomena.

Getting Started

Clone the Repo:textgit clone https://github.com/yourusername/expressionalism.git
cd expressionalism
Run the Python Script: Requires Python 3.12+ with libraries like NumPy, SciPy, Pandas (install via pip install -r requirements.txt if added). Example:textpython scripts/expressionalism_toolkit.py --input "The sky is blue due to Rayleigh scattering"
Customize with toggles: --toggles Density_Probe=On.
Output: Tables, metrics, narratives for certainties/uncertainties.
