Expressionalism is a provisional, dialectical framework for measuring meaning through expressions. It bootstraps from ontological neutrality to relational truths and tensive ratios, deriving meaning as tensions between certainties (connectable contrasts, alignments, utilities) and uncertainties (gaps, pauses, unknowables).  
Agnostic to metaphysics and equitable across traditions (analytic, Eastern non-duals, indigenous), it includes 11 self-enforcing presumptions with baked-in fallibility. Use it to unpack ideas, refine claims, or analyze expressions in philosophy, AI, or semiotics.

## **What is Expressionalism?**

Expressionalism is a simple way to think about anything we notice or say in life.

Picture this: Every idea, feeling, or thing you experience—like a random thought popping into your head, a picture you see, a quiet moment, or something said out loud—is an "expression" here. It's your way of grabbing onto something and trying to connect it to other stuff, while spotting the parts that don't quite fit or stay mysterious.

You can start from either end:

* Go forward from zero assumptions—no big claims about God, the universe, or whether anything's "real" at all—and build up step by step to figure out what holds together in that expression: Look for patterns that link up reliably, like guessing how one idea relates to another, and call those "certainties." At the same time, respect the gaps or unknowns that can't connect, labeling them "uncertainties." Truth here just means those guessed connections feel solid for now, and meaning comes from the balance between what clicks and what doesn't—kind of like how a puzzle feels complete even with missing pieces.  
* Or go backward: Start from an expression you think is true, and peel layers off like an onion to spot what has to be presumed just to make it "work" or feel "known."

It's not about proving anything forever; it's humble and changeable. Certainty and uncertainty have to exist together no matter what we think, claim, or know for sure about the world, life, being, existence, or whatever is out there—and it all hangs together because of the expression that makes it possible in the first place.

At the end of the day, it's always okay to re-express in a different way; that just becomes your fresh starting point.

## **Key Features**

* Equitable and fallible by design: Self-refutes where needed, elevates marginal perspectives.  
* Toolkit: Phases, toggles (e.g., Certainty Temper Probe), metrics (e.g., harmony index prioritizing fragility).  
* Python script: Analyzes inputs for certainties, uncertainties, and yields.  
* For addressed critiques, see docs/critiques-addressed.docx.
