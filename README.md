Expressionalism: Measuring Meaning

Python 3.12+
Expressionalism is a provisional, dialectical framework for measuring meaning through expressions. It bootstraps from ontological neutrality to relational truths and tensive ratios, deriving meaning as tensions between certainties (connectable contrasts, alignments, utilities) and uncertainties (gaps, pauses, unknowables).
Agnostic to metaphysics and equitable across traditions (analytic, Eastern non-duals, indigenous), it includes 11 self-enforcing presumptions with baked-in fallibility. Use it to unpack ideas, refine claims, or analyze expressions in philosophy, AI, or semiotics.

What is Expressionalism?
Expressionalism starts from ontological neutrality and builds conditional structures for expressions—fallible secondary expressions emerging as probabilistic relations. Truth is guessed, meaning is certainty-uncertainty tension.
Key Features:

Equitable and fallible by design: Self-refutes where needed, elevates marginal perspectives.
Toolkit: Phases, toggles (e.g., Certainty Temper Probe), metrics (e.g., harmony index prioritizing fragility).
Python script: Analyzes inputs for certainties, uncertainties, and yields.
